# Ajax-Chosen

This project is an addition to the excellent [Chosen jQuery plugin](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen) that makes HTML input forms more friendly.  Chosen adds search boxes to `select` HTML elements, so I felt it could use the addition of ajax autocomplete for awesomely dynamic forms.

This script bootstraps the existing Chosen plugin without making any modifications to the original code. Eventually, I would love to see this functionality built-in to the library, but until then, this seems to work pretty well.

## How to Use

This plugin exposes a new jQuery function named `ajaxChosen` that we call on a `select` element. The first argument consists of the options passed to the jQuery $.ajax function. The `data` parameter is optional, and the `success` callback is also optional.

The second argument is a callback that tells the plugin what HTML `option` elements to make. It is passed the data returned from the ajax call, and you have to return an object where the keys are the HTML `option` elements' `value` attributes, and the values are the text to display for each option. In other words:

	{"3": "Ohio"}

becomes:

	<option value="3">Ohio</option>

or for grouping:

	{"3": {
		group: true,
		text: "City",
		items: {
			"10": "Stockholm",
			"23": "Moskow"
		}
	}

becomes:

        <optgroup label="City">
            <option value="10">Stockholm</option>
            <option value="23">Moskow</option>
        </optgroup>

Note: 

Due to a bug in Chosen, it is necessary to change `choosen.css`.

Add 

	display: list-item;

to 

	.chzn-container .chzn-results .group-result {

class

### Options

There are some additional ajax-chosen specific options you can pass into the first argument to control its behavior.

* `minTermLength`: minimum number of characters that must be typed before an ajax call is fired
* `afterTypeDelay`: how many milliseconds to wait after typing stops to fire the ajax call
* `jsonTermKey`: the ajax request key to use for the search query (defaults to `term`)

## Example Code

``` js
$("#example-input").ajaxChosen({
	type: 'GET',
	url: '/ajax-chosen/data.php',
	dataType: 'json'
}, function (data) {
	var results = {};
	
	$.each(data, function (i, val) {
		results[i] = val;
	});
	
	return results;
});
```
To have the results grouped in `optgroup` elements, have the function return a list of group objects instead:

``` js
$("#example-input").ajaxChosen({
	type: 'GET',
	url: '/ajax-chosen/grouped.php',
	dataType: 'json'
}, function (data) {
	var results = {};
	$.each(data, function (i, val) {
		results[i] = { // here's a group object:
			group: true,
			text: val.name, // label for the group
			items: {} // individual options within the group
		};
		$.each(val.Values, function (i1, val1) {
			results[i].items[val1.Id] = val1.name;
		});
	});
	return results;
});

```
