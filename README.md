# Ajax-Chosen

This project is an addition to the excellent [Chosen jQuery plugin](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen) that makes HTML input forms more friendly.  Chosen adds search boxes to `select` HTML elements, so I felt it could use the addition of ajax autocomplete for awesomely dynamic forms.

This script bootstraps the existing Chosen plugin without making any modifications to the original code. Eventually I would love to see this functionality built-in to the library, but until then, this seems to work pretty well.

## How to Use

This plugin exposes a new jQuery function named `ajaxChosen` that we call on a `select` element. The first argument are the options passed to the jQuery $.ajax function. The `data` parameter can be used to send parameters to the service, except `term` that is used to send the search string, and the `success` callback is optional.

The second argument is a callback that tells the plugin what HTML `option` elements to make. It is passed the data returned from the ajax call, and you have to return an object where the key is the HTML `option` value attribute and the value is the text to display. In other words:

	terms[3] = "Ohio";
	
becomes:
	
	<option value="3">Ohio</option>

## Example Code

``` js
$("#example-input").ajaxChosen({
	method: 'GET',
	url: '/ajax-chosen/data.php',
	data: { user_id: 23 },
	dataType: 'json'
}, function (data) {
	var terms = {};
			
	$.each(data, function (i, val) {
		terms[i] = val;
	});
			
	return terms;
});
```
